#[davidawad.github.io](davidawad.github.io)


This is a simple project I made as my first website. I have been sharing it with friends family and potential employers to demonstrate my abilities as a Web Developer.

I've since learned much more jQuery as well as a couple of frameworks. Such as Foundation! 


##I'm building a new site.

If you want to see my new site go check out the [repo](https://github.com/DavidAwad/NewSite). 

##Thanks for Looking!

### Huge Thanks to [Jacopo colo](https://github.com/jacopocolo) for the codebase of this website.
